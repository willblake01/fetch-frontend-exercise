### Instructions
* Login with your name and email
* On the search dogs page filter dogs by your desired criteria
* Select the dogs you'd like to include in your match algorithm by clicking the card, they will hightlight in purple
* Once you've made your selections click match and meet your new dog!!!

### Requirements
* node version 20.x
* npm version 10.x

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Setup

Install the [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) to easily debug and see what's going on in your React app.

Your text editor may not natively support the JSX syntax that is used in this project, but there may be plugins to get proper syntax highlighting. For example, Sublime Text uses the `Babel` plugin.

Then, clone this repository (click the green button saying "Clone or Download", choose http, and copy and paste it the location `<url>` ) and go into it:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:willblake01/fetch-frontend-exercise.git
$ cd fetch-frontend-exercise
```

Install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

After that's done, run this to start development:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start running the app and automatically open it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Anytime you change and save the code, it will automatically reload! This will remain a running process in your terminal, so you will need to open a new tab or window to execute other commands.

### Optional Setup
Prettier is a tool that automatically reformats your code to follow a certain set of coding style guidelines. It is configured to run automatically before each commit. This makes sure all of our code follows the same code styles, enforcing good practices and minimizing conflicts.

There are prettier plugins you can install for your editor. See instructions [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration).
